- Provide a decentralized environment for creators to directly sell their work.
- Allow gamers and collectors to buy, sell, and auction their digital assets.

## Future Scope
The platform has a wide range of future opportunities:
- Integration with more gaming ecosystems and platforms for NFT trade.
- Expansion of the platform to support more types of digital assets like skins, avatars, and in-game items.
- Development of a community-driven DAO to vote on platform improvements and features.
- Integrating cross-platform NFT functionalities for a more immersive gaming experience.

## Key Features
